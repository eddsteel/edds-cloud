Code for my site.

All information is gathered from other parts of the web, and stored in a
CouchDB database. At present information is gathered by RSS from google
reader, delicous and twitter automatically.

It is then available in a RESTful manner.

Future plans:

* Site support
	* twitter API for richer metadata
	* github commits
	* flickr activity
* More alternate representations, system of frontends
  to mix and match with backends.
	* JSON
	* Add microformats to HTML5 representation
* Conditional GET
