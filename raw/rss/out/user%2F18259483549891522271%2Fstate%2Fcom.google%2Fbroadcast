This whole blog is pure gold.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A guy goes into a bank and says he wants to borrow $200 for six months. The loan officer asks him what collateral he has, and he says, “I have a Rolls Royce. Here are the keys — you can keep it until the loan is paid off.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Six months later the guy comes back and pays off the $200 loan, plus $10 interest. The loan officer says, “Here are the keys. If you don’t mind my asking, why would a man who owns a Rolls Royce need to borrow $200?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The guy says, “I had to go overseas for six months. Where else could I store a Rolls Royce for $10?”&lt;/p&gt;

Atheists and agnostics have a wider religious knowledge than the religious. Not so surprising, the religious are more likely to think there's only one religion worth knowing about.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Pew Research Center recently ran a religious knowledge survey in the US and &lt;a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Other-Beliefs-and-Practices/U-S-Religious-Knowledge-Survey.aspx"&gt;the results&lt;/a&gt; show that atheists and agnostics know more about religion than adherents of various Judeo-Christian religions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, Americans correctly answer 16 of the 32 religious knowledge questions on the survey by the Pew Research Center&amp;#39;s Forum on Religion &amp;amp; Public Life. Atheists and agnostics average 20.9 correct answers. Jews and Mormons do about as well, averaging 20.5 and 20.3 correct answers, respectively. Protestants as a whole average 16 correct answers; Catholics as a whole, 14.7. Atheists and agnostics, Jews and Mormons perform better than other groups on the survey even after controlling for differing levels of education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can &lt;a href="http://features.pewforum.org/quiz/us-religious-knowledge"&gt;take a sample survey here&lt;/a&gt;. Woo, 15/15.

SpEak You're bRanes on common sense. I think dealing with have your sayers is starting to really get to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Common sense is the artificial inflation of the value of meagre knowledge. It’s the intellectual equivalent of ‘having a good personality’. It’s the consolation prize for those too dim to achieve anything beyond remembering to breathe for long enough to reproduce. It’s the same level of earthy wisdom that deems modern art ‘crap’, pure research ‘a waste of time’ and Strictly Come Dancing ‘entertainment’. It’s the undentable armour of the stupid, and you’ll never catch them without it. You take it away from them, they’ve got nothing. They’re left naked in the laughing face of their own inferiority, with no choice but to confront the meandering pointlessness of their lives. Which is a lot to confront all in one go.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/haveyoursay/2010/09/should_the_government_ask_you.html"&gt;Should the government ask you for policy ideas?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m sure this is a proper dickhive of idiocy, but I spent five hours the other night trawling an entire Mail thread on Wayne/Jeni/Coleen, and quite frankly, I can’t be arsed having a decent rummage. Y’all will have to be satisfied with what Tony sent our way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anything thats of non use needs to be out.I have many ideas of how to save and prosper but its too much to post here.All men have minds and its not just those in charge who have great ideas.The public has men of great minds out there but they are unheard of and mainly have to expierience deaf ears by those who proclaim themselves as higher knowledge than thee.SO most ideas fall by the wayside and common sense is thrown out.Ignorance is of no shortage by those who have title.Most self serving and unwilling to take the publics input are put aside and scoffed at.This is the mistake of the ages and we as a whole are held back by decisions and ideas of these deaf ears and serve none but themselves or their parties.Mans ignorance attests to all this.No wonder we cannot move forward.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Michael&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common sense, and the people who eulogise it – is anything more depressing? Obviously, leave aside all the wars and shit, and the senseless brutality of nature, and the sheer futility of all human endeavour, and the fact that each one of us is ultimately alone, captive on a rock hurtling through a godless universe towards its eventual destruction, and all the other stuff. Put all that to one side, then ask yourselves: is anything more depressing than common sense and the people who eulogise it? Surely not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Common sense is the artificial inflation of the value of meagre knowledge. It’s the intellectual equivalent of ‘having a good personality’. It’s the consolation prize for those too dim to achieve anything beyond remembering to breathe for long enough to reproduce. It’s the same level of earthy wisdom that deems modern art ‘crap’, pure research ‘a waste of time’ and Strictly Come Dancing ‘entertainment’. It’s the undentable armour of the stupid, and you’ll never catch them without it. You take it away from them, they’ve got nothing.

&lt;p&gt;They cling to it out of fear. Pity them.&lt;/p&gt;

Our work confirms that there is a significant efficiency gap," said Bill Emery, chairman of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year the commuter watchdog, Passenger Focus, said travellers were paying 50% more than rail users on the continent. The study prompted calls to scrap the government policy of annual price increases but the transport secretary, Philip Hammond, is considering higher-than-expected fare rises in January in an attempt to reduce taxpayers' annual £3.7bn subsidy for Network Rail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Passenger Focus warned today that the rail industry's steep maintenance and engineering costs – Network Rail will spend £30bn between 2009 and 2014 – are turning the screw on commuters facing a minimum increase in season ticket prices of at least 5.8% next year. Under the government's fares formula ticket prices can rise by one percentage point above July's inflation figure, which was 4.8%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost of the track and signals feeds through, albeit indirectly, into fares," said Anthony Smith, Passenger Focus's chief executive. "We need to understand why Network Rail is different [compared with the continent]. Is it health and safety? Is it just the cost of borrowing from the banks? Let's find out why and then make some decisions about what we are buying from Network Rail and whether we need it at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The funding split between farepayers and taxpayers is 50/50 currently but passengers' contribution will reach 75% – around £9bn a year – by 2014. Hammond has refused to rule out allowing fares to rise by more than 5.8%, leading to speculation that he might sanction a 10% increase in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network Rail said  it was on track to achieve a 21% reduction in costs by the middle of the decade. The company, whose finances are underwritten by government grants and state-backed debt, said the general cost of infrastructure work in the UK was the biggest cause of cost inflation on the railways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cost of construction, civil engineering and labour rates is more expensive than in Europe. Whether it is building a bridge, a railway or a house, it is more expensive in the UK than elsewhere. There are wider questions to ask," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ORR comparison with 11 European countries found that Network Rail could learn some lessons from its peers in how it carries out engineering work over weekends and bank holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study found that one explanation of the efficiency gap between Network Rail and the rest of Europe was "the way NR carries out [track] possessions". The regulator urged Network Rail to collaborate more closely with train operators on line closures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/rail-transport"&gt;Rail transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/transport"&gt;Transport&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/danmilmo"&gt;Dan Milmo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/5ah1nlegk960hjmo91i6b6o7v0/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2010%2Fsep%2F08%2Fbritain-railways-most-expensive-europe" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>Dan Milmo</name></author><gr:likingUser>05461869933964301941</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,1,00.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,1,00.xml</id><title type="html">The Guardian World News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1283969393381"><id gr:original-id="">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/5ea917e34dedef5e</id><title type="html">Morgan confirmed as heir to King</title><published>2010-09-08T18:09:53Z</published><updated>2010-09-08T18:09:53Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/08/piers-morgan-larry-king-chatshow" type="text/html"/><link rel="related" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" title="The Guardian World News"/><content xml:base="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/sep/08/piers-morgan-larry-king-chatshow" type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;Shared by  edd

Morgan will be based in New York but also work from Los Angeles and London, according to CNN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have watched Larry King Live for much of the last 25 years, and dreamed of one day filling the legendary suspenders of the man I consider to be the greatest TV interviewer of them all," Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Klein, CNN US president, added: "Piers has made his name posing tough questions to public figures, holding them accountable for their words and deeds. He is able to look at all aspects of the news with style and humour with an occasional good laugh in the process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jun/30/larry-king-25-years-cnn" title="King announced in June that he would be stepping down from hosting Larry King Live"&gt;King announced in June that he would be stepping down from Larry King Live&lt;/a&gt;, which he has presented on CNN since 1985, bringing down the curtain on a broadcasting career spanning more than 50 years and, by his reckoning, more than 50,000 interviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2010/jul/14/piers-morgan-cnn-larry-king" title="It was widely reported the following month"&gt;It was widely reported the following month&lt;/a&gt; that Morgan, best known to US viewers as a judge on NBC's America's Got Talent, would replace King. However, confirmation of Morgan's CNN deal &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/richard-adams-blog/2010/aug/20/piers-morgan-cnn-visa" title=" is understood to have been delayed while is US visa was sorted out"&gt; is understood to have been delayed while is US visa was sorted out&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks were also complicated by Morgan's commitments to NBC. His NBC contract prevented him from taking on extra work that clashed with the show, but this has now reportedly been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many of the interviews for the CNN show, broadcast in the key 9pm slot on the US east coast, are recorded and Morgan will still have time to star in the NBC talent contest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan is expected to quit his judging role on Britain's Got Talent as a result of his CNN commitments. But he will continue to make one-off shows for ITV as well as two further series of the interview show Piers Morgan's Life Stories, each running to 12 programmes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landing the CNN job caps a remarkable comeback for Morgan, 45, who was sacked as Daily Mirror editor in 2004 &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2004/may/14/pressandpublishing.iraqandthemedia" title="for running fake pictures of British troops "&gt;for running fake pictures of British troops "abusing" Iraqi prisoners&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He began his rehabilitation with the publication of The Insider, his memoir of a decade mixing with celebrities and politicians as editor of the News of the World and then the Daily Mirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan then moved into TV as a judge on Britain's Got Talent, before landing the same role in the US version of Simon Cowell's talent show format and his own ITV chatshow, Piers Morgan's Life Stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June he interrupted negotations with CNN &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/jun/25/piers-morgan-wedding-celia-walden" title="to celebrate his second marriage"&gt;to celebrate his second marriage&lt;/a&gt;, to Daily Telegraph journalist Celia Walden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;• &lt;em&gt;To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="mailto:editor@mediaguardian.co.uk" title=""&gt;&lt;em&gt;editor@mediaguardian.co.uk&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; or phone 020 3353 3857.

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href="http://www.thenervouscook.com"&gt;Photographs: Erin Meister&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are coffee people, and there are tea people, but are there coffee-tea people? I don't just mean those who obsessively drink both bevvies (I'm a member of that club), but the lucky ones currently drinking &lt;strong&gt;"tea" made from coffee.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;h4&gt;Coffee Cherries, the Fruit Around the Coffee Bean&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="20100901-coffeetea-dried.jpg" src="http://www.seriouseats.com/images/20100901-coffeetea-dried.jpg" width="500" height="333"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dried coffee cherries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we call the fruit that bears our coffee beans &amp;quot;cherry,&amp;quot; you might be surprised to discover it&amp;#39;s not nearly as meaty or juicy as the ones used in Grandma&amp;#39;s famous pie. The beans take up most of the real estate inside the little red pods, which makes the fruit itself not that great for snacking—unless you want to crack a tooth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That doesn't mean it's not delicious, though: &lt;strong&gt;When dried, the cherry can be steeped just like tea, and makes an incredibly syrupy and aromatic cup somewhat reminiscent of &lt;a href="http://www.rishi-tea.com/store/african-rooibos/"&gt;rooibos&lt;/a&gt; or a hibiscus infusion.&lt;/strong&gt; Called &lt;strong&gt;cascara&lt;/strong&gt; in Spanish, the dried cherry husks are a rare find in this part of the globe, though it's not uncommon to run into this sensual drink in coffee-growing regions farther east, such as in Yemen where the husks are used to make a hot ginger-spiced drink called &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qishr"&gt;qishr&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Coffee Tea Tasting&lt;/h4&gt; 

&lt;p&gt;Last Friday at the &lt;a href="http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/education/coffee-cupping"&gt;regular weekly coffee tasting&lt;/a&gt; I host with my &lt;a href="http://www.counterculturecoffee.com"&gt;Counter Culture&lt;/a&gt; colleagues (yes, you can come; no, you don't need any experience), we got the kind-of-insanely-awesome opportunity to sample the cascara from three different farms, all of which are owned by the coffee-growing industry's equivalent to Mick Jagger: El Salvadorian farm owner and coffee producer &lt;strong&gt;Aida Battle&lt;/strong&gt;. We were curious about the trio because the farms—&lt;a href="http://counterculturecoffee.com/coffee/cascara?page=shop.browse&amp;amp;category_id=28"&gt;Finca Mauritania, Finca los Alpes, and Finca Kilimanjaro&lt;/a&gt;—are planted with different bean varieties. &lt;strong&gt;But would there be a discernible difference on the palate between the fruits themselves?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remarkably, there certainly is: While harder to detect in the aromas, the Finca los Alpes was noticeably tart and tobacco-like next to the brown-sugar sweetness of Finca Mauritania, while the more delicate Finca Kilimanjaro was intensely floral, sweet, and appley. And yes, I'm fully aware that this is why coffee people get made fun of the same way wine people do. Maybe you have to taste it to believe it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And taste it you should: &lt;strong&gt;I think every coffee lover should jump on the chance to get their mitts on some of this stuff when the opportunity arises.&lt;/strong&gt; I mean, when are you ever going to get to visit a coffee farm and eat a cherry right off the tree? This is as close to that as many of us will ever get, and we may as well savor it. (Heck—&lt;em&gt;ice&lt;/em&gt; it. It makes an &lt;a href="http://www.counterculturecoffee.com/education/online-brewing-guide/357-iced-cascara"&gt;awesome iced tea&lt;/a&gt;, too.)&lt;/p&gt;

The vice president of a company went to the chairman of the board and said, ‘We are thinking of starting a new program. It will help us increase profits, but it will also harm the environment.’ The chairman of the board answered, ‘I don’t care at all about harming the environment. I just want to make as much profit as I can. Let’s start the new program.’ They started the new program. Sure enough, the environment was harmed.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did the chairman harm the environment intentionally? In a 2003 study, 82 percent of respondents said yes, he did. But now consider this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did the chairman help the environment intentionally? Only 23 percent of respondents said yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What should we make of this? Yale philosopher Joshua Knobe says, “It seems very puzzling that all we changed was this one word, just changing the word &lt;em&gt;harm&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;help&lt;/em&gt;, and yet we’re now having completely different judgments about whether what he did was intentional or unintentional. Yet it seems like it’s only the moral status of what he did that is changing. … Somehow the moral judgments people are making are affecting their intuitions about something like how the mind works.”&lt;/p&gt;

width="1" height="1"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coded in html5 and starring your childhood home, Arcade Fire have breathed new life into the medium. After all, why sit and watch when you can play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you've got a fancy computer – and don't mind being reminded of your childhood home – chances are you have spent the morning mucking about with &lt;a href="http://www.thewildernessdowntown.com" title=""&gt;thewildernessdowntown.com&lt;/a&gt;. It's described as a "musical experience made specifically for Google Chrome" that takes the Arcade Fire song We Used to Wait and pits it against scenes of your childhood home, rendered by Google maps. It's got techy types in a tizz – not least because it's a neat demonstration of some of the cooler tricks offered by html5, the next evolution in coding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's an equally impressive piece of viral marketing too. I can't stand Arcade Fire, but I've already shared it with hundreds of my friends. Thanks to making the website's animated hoodie run around the grounds of Doncaster Rovers Football Club, my old school, and (don't ask me why) Battersea power station, it's forced a tune I would otherwise have little desire to hear into the recesses of my brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Admittedly the experience is a little buggy – if your screen isn't big enough you might find certain pop-up windows lost in the depths of what you're looking at. But if you look at the idea as a sketch of what might come next, it certainly suggests an evolution is on the cards for music videos. It also poses the question: why watch when you can play?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arcade Fire have previous history with this sort of thing. Earlier this month their live-streamed YouTube concert directed by Terry Gilliam was watched by 3.7 million viewers. In putting The Wilderness Downtown online this weekend, they have once again proved they are a band willing to embrace the internet and the possibilities it brings (rather than moaning about lost revenue sales like pretty much everyone else). Better still, they've made someone who can't stand their music genuinely excited about what they might do next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style="float:left;margin-right:10px;margin-bottom:10px"&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/arcadefire"&gt;Arcade Fire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/popandrock"&gt;Pop and rock&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/html5"&gt;HTML5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/google"&gt;Google&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/internet"&gt;Internet&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/software"&gt;Software&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/james-mcmahon"&gt;James McMahon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk"&gt;guardian.co.uk&lt;/a&gt; © Guardian News &amp;amp; Media Limited 2010 | Use of this content is subject to our &lt;a href="http://users.guardian.co.uk/help/article/0,,933909,00.html"&gt;Terms &amp;amp; Conditions&lt;/a&gt; | &lt;a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/help/feeds"&gt;More Feeds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style="clear:both"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe src="http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~ah/f/5ah1nlegk960hjmo91i6b6o7v0/300/250?ca=1&amp;amp;fh=280#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fmusic%2Fmusicblog%2F2010%2Faug%2F31%2Farcade-fire-future-music-videos" width="100%" height="280" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" marginwidth="0" marginheight="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</summary><author><name>James McMahon</name></author><gr:likingUser>18259483549891522271</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>01864263539896852703</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>17577767458983902337</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>18084083129020029771</gr:likingUser><gr:likingUser>00184445683981814303</gr:likingUser><source gr:stream-id="feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,1,00.xml"><id>tag:google.com,2005:reader/feed/http://www.guardian.co.uk/rssfeed/0,,1,00.xml</id><title type="html">The Guardian World News</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk" type="text/html"/></source></entry><entry gr:crawl-timestamp-msec="1265892373486"><id gr:original-id="tag:radar.oreilly.com,2010://57.39094">tag:google.com,2005:reader/item/6e92c940d8826747</id><category term="facebook" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="facebook"/><category term="gmail" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="gmail"/><category term="google" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="google"/><category term="mobile" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="mobile"/><category term="twitter" scheme="http://www.sixapart.com/ns/types#tag" label="twitter"/><title type="html">Google Buzz: Is it Project, Product or Platform?</title><published>2010-02-10T18:56:22Z</published><updated>2010-02-10T18:56:22Z</updated><link rel="alternate" href="http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/oreilly/radar/atom/~3/RYyRXydd7vg/google-buzz-is-it-project-prod.html" type="text/html"/><content xml:base="http://radar.oreilly.com/" xml:lang="en" type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style="display:inline"&gt;&lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/assets_c/2010/02/googlebuzz1.html"&gt;&lt;img src="http://radar.oreilly.com/assets_c/2010/02/googlebuzz-thumb-300x81.png" width="300" height="81" alt="googlebuzz.png" style="float:right;margin:0 0 10px 10px"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;I think that it's great that Google is iterating Gmail (read Tim O'Reilly's excellent write-up on it &lt;a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/2010/02/google-buzz-re-invents-gmail.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and actually improving an &lt;strong&gt;existing&lt;/strong&gt; product, versus rolling out a knock-off of something that is already in the market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless.  I am confused.  I thought that Google Wave was destined to be the new Gmail, but after yesterday's announcement, I am left wondering if Gmail is, instead, the new Google Wave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did that happen? Well, for starters, the Company is so obtuse about what's a &lt;strong&gt;Project&lt;/strong&gt;, what's a &lt;strong&gt;Product&lt;/strong&gt; and what's a &lt;strong&gt;Platform&lt;/strong&gt; that I am unsure if &lt;a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/introducing-google-buzz.html"&gt;Google Buzz&lt;/a&gt; is to be treated akin to a "concept car" or if it constitutes a real strategic initiative within the Company. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Worse, Google has this somewhat head-achey culture of creating overlapping offerings (think: Buzz, Wave, Reader, Talk, Gmail, Chrome, Android), and then giving cloudy guidance on demarcation lines between what is what. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a customer, partner or developer, wouldn't it be nice if they could just be clear where they are experimenting, where there's a committed road map with release dates and where the offering ties into a larger vision (e.g., core technologies with unified strategies)?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, wouldn't Google Reader be better nested inside of this buzz-able Gmail than in its current wooden frame?  Will the Company ever have a unified reader/player model?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, if Android is the hot mobile platform, why do we need Chrome?  Will tablet devices, a hybrid between mobile devices and netbooks, be Chrome powered or Android powered?  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adding to the confusion, over the years I have seen enough cases where Google offerings sit in Google Labs, yet by all accounts, are real products.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other cases, the term Beta is more marketing moniker than anything; it doesn't really mean anything, as it's not like Google is (generally) committing to dates and deliverables.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, in other cases, we just stop hearing about the offering, but even in those cases, the product never fully dies (read: Orkut).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of this leaves me wondering what in Google's DNA suggests a culture of delighting customers, and relentlessly focusing on the details needed to deliver a better user experience that is supported by a clear strategy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If anything, the "Google Way" has taught me that their loosely-coupled approach leads to uninspiring, weakly integrated products that may or may not have a predictable lifecycle to them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Put another way, why should I pay prolonged, serious attention to Google Buzz until Google shows that THEY are committed to paying prolonged, serious attention to it?&lt;/p&gt;

I'm a big fan of Joey DeVilla's excellent blog, &lt;a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com"&gt;Global Nerdy&lt;/a&gt;, but I take exception to his post &lt;a href="http://www.globalnerdy.com/2009/05/26/fast-food-apple-pies-and-why-netbooks-suck/"&gt;Fast Food, Apple Pies, and Why Netbooks Suck&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
he end result, to my mind, is a device that occupies an uncomfortable, middle ground between laptops and smartphones that tries to please everyone and pleases no one. Consider the factors:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Size: A bit too large to go into your pocket; a bit too small for regular day-to-day work.
&lt;li&gt;Power: Slightly more capable than a smartphone; slightly less capable than a laptop.
&lt;li&gt;Price: Slightly higher than a higher-end smartphone but lacking a phone's capability and portability; slightly lower than a lower-end notebook but lacking a notebook's speed and storage.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
To summarize: Slightly bigger and pricier than a phone, but can't phone. Slightly smaller and cheaper than a laptop, but not that much smaller or cheaper. To adapt a phrase I used in an article I wrote yesterday, &lt;b&gt;netbooks are like laptops, but lamer.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
This is so wrongheaded I am not sure where to begin. I happen to &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2008/10/22/whyILikeNetbooks.html"&gt;agree with Dave Winer's definition of "netbook"&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small size.
&lt;li&gt;Low price.
&lt;li&gt;Battery life of 4+ hours. Battery can be replaced by user. 
&lt;li&gt;Rugged.
&lt;li&gt;Built-in wifi, 3 USB ports, SD card reader.
&lt;li&gt;Runs my software.
&lt;li&gt;Runs any software I want; no platform vendor to decide what's appropriate.
&lt;li&gt;Competition. Users have choice and can switch vendors at any time.
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Netbooks are the endpoint of four decades of computing -- the final, ubiquitous manifestation of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft"&gt;"A PC on every desk and in every home"&lt;/a&gt;. But netbooks are more than just PCs. If the internet is the ultimate force of democratization in the world, then netbooks are the instrument by which that democracy will be achieved.
&lt;p&gt;
No monthly fees and contracts.
&lt;p&gt;
No gatekeepers.
&lt;p&gt;
Nobody telling you what you can and can't do with your hardware, or on their network.
&lt;p&gt;
To dismiss netbooks as &lt;i&gt;like laptops, but lamer&lt;/i&gt; is to completely miss the importance of this pivotal moment in computing -- when the ubiquity of the internet, and the mass production of inexpensive portable computers finally intersected. I'm talking about &lt;b&gt;unlimited access to the complete sum of human knowledge, and free, unfettered communication with anyone on earth.&lt;/b&gt; For everyone.
&lt;p&gt;
It's true that smartphones are slowly becoming little PCs, but they will never be &lt;i&gt;free&lt;/i&gt; PCs. They will forever be locked behind an imposing series of gatekeepers and toll roads. Anyone with a $199 netbook and access to the internet can make free Skype videophone calls to anywhere on Earth, for as long as they want. Meanwhile, sending a single text message on a smartphone costs 4 times as much as &lt;a href="http://www.physorg.com/news129793047.html"&gt;transmitting data to the Hubble space telescope&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I don't care how "smart" your smartphone is, it will never escape those corporate shackles. Smartphones are simply &lt;i&gt;not free enough&lt;/i&gt; to deliver the type of democratic transformation that netbooks -- mobile PCs cheap enough and fast enough and good enough for everyone to afford -- absolutely will.
&lt;p&gt;
That's why I love netbooks. In all their cheap, crappy glory. And you should too. Because they're &lt;a href="http://www.scripting.com/stories/2009/10/14/whatsObviousAboutNetbooks.html"&gt;instruments of user power&lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The truly significant thing is this -- the users took over.
&lt;p&gt;
Let me say that again: &lt;i&gt;The users took over&lt;/i&gt;.
&lt;p&gt;
I always say this is the lesson of the tech industry, but the people in the tech industry never believe it, but this is the loop. In the late 70s and early 80s the minicomputer and mainframe guys said the same kinds of things about Apple IIs and IBM PCs that Michael Dell is saying about netbooks. It happens over and over again, I've recited the loops so many times that every reader of this column can recite them from memory. All that has to be said is that it happened again.
&lt;p&gt;
Once out, the genie never goes back in the bottle.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Netbooks aren't an alternative to notebook computers. &lt;b&gt;They &lt;i&gt;are&lt;/i&gt; the new computers.&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Cheap and crappy? Maybe those early models were, but having purchased a new netbook for $439 shipped, it is difficult for me to imagine the average user ever paying more than $500 for a laptop.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Acer%20AS1410&amp;amp;tag=codinghorror_20&amp;amp;index=blended&amp;amp;link_code=qs"&gt;&lt;img src="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/images/acer-aspire-1410.jpg" width="449" height="490" alt="acer aspire 1410" border="0"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
For the price, this is an astonishingly capable PC:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dual Core 1.2 GHz Intel CULV Celeron processor
&lt;li&gt;2 GB RAM
&lt;li&gt;Windows 7 Home Premium
&lt;li&gt;11.6" screen with 1366 x 768 resolution
&lt;li&gt;Thin (1") and light (3.5 lbs)
&lt;li&gt;Good battery life (5 hours)
&lt;li&gt;3 USB ports, WiFi, webcam, gigabit ethernet
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Windows 7 is a fine OS, but this machine would surely be cheaper without &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000870.html"&gt;the Microsoft Tax&lt;/a&gt;, too.
&lt;p&gt;
The &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/s?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;keywords=Acer%20AS1410&amp;amp;tag=codinghorror_20&amp;amp;index=blended&amp;amp;link_code=qs"&gt;Acer Aspire 1410&lt;/a&gt; isn't just an adequate little netbook, it's a damn good &lt;i&gt;computer&lt;/i&gt;. At these specifications, it is a huge step up from those early netbook models in every way. But don't take my word for it; read the reviews at &lt;a href="http://netbooked.net/netbook-reviews/review/11.6-acer-aspire-as1410-celeron-su2300-review/"&gt;netbooked&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://www.liliputing.com/2009/11/acer-aspire-1410-review-dual-core-version.html"&gt;Liliputing&lt;/a&gt;. (Caveat emptor -- there are lots of 1410 models, and the newer dual core CPU version is the one you want.)
&lt;p&gt;
Of particular note is the CPU. While the Intel Atom is &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3276"&gt;a technological marvel&lt;/a&gt;, I don't feel current Atom CPUs deliver quite enough performance for a modern, JavaScript-heavy, video-intensive internet experience. It is quite clear that Intel is &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=3693&amp;amp;p=8"&gt;intentionally hobbling&lt;/a&gt; newer iterations of the Atom CPU in the name of market segregation, and to prevent too much netbook price erosion.
&lt;p&gt;
That's why the current &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumer_Ultra-Low_Voltage"&gt;Intel CULV CPUs&lt;/a&gt; are far more attractive options -- they're &lt;a href="http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=3699&amp;amp;p=4"&gt;dramatically faster&lt;/a&gt;, and have become power-efficient marvels in their own right. I hooked up &lt;a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000353.html"&gt;my watt meter&lt;/a&gt; to this Aspire 1410 and I was surprised to find it consume &lt;b&gt;between 13 and 16 watts&lt;/b&gt; of power in typical use -- while my wife was browsing the web in Firefox, over a wireless connection, with multiple tabs open. I fired up Prime95 torture test to force the CPU to 100% load, and measured &lt;b&gt;21 watts&lt;/b&gt; with one CPU core fully loaded, and &lt;b&gt;26 watts&lt;/b&gt; when both were. These are wall measurements which reflect power conversion inefficiencies of at least 20%, so real consumption was between 10 and 20 watts. I was wondering why it ran so cool; now I know. It barely uses enough power to generate any heat!
&lt;p&gt;
Modern netbooks are not cheap and crappy. They're remarkably solid little boxes, and getting better every day. Which &lt;a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/21/read-my-lips/"&gt;makes me wonder&lt;/a&gt;:
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A recurring question among Apple watchers for decades has been, “When is Apple going to introduce a low-cost computer?
&lt;p&gt;
Steve Jobs answered that decades-old complaint by stating, "We don't know how to build a sub-$500 computer that is not a piece of junk."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
They may be pieces of junk to Mr. Jobs, but to me, these modest little boxes are tiny marvels -- inspiring evidence of the inexorable march of powerful, open computing technology to everyman and everywhere levels.
&lt;p&gt;
We have produced &lt;b&gt;a democracy of netbooks&lt;/b&gt;. And the geek in me can't wait to see what happens next.

type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Introduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the advent of agile programming and continuous integration, the number of builds run in a company have increased considerably. This is great from a testing and early bug-spotting point of view, but it puts a considerable strain on the Perforce server, which can hamper performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performance is what a Perforce server is all about; therefore we need strategies to cope with the additional load from build servers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is there an impact on performance?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Build servers tend to populate a fresh workspace with all files required for the build, which often means thousands of files. This affects the Perforce server in three ways:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The server needs to calculate first which files need to be synced, locking several database tables in the process.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The files need to be retrieved from the depots, which can lead to disk contention and file system cache thrashing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The db.have table needs to be updated after the files are synced, which locks that table.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All these problems can be solved easily. This will lead to a more responsive Perforce server and faster builds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use “sync -p” for build workspaces&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The option “-p” was officially introduced in 2007.2 for build workspaces. From the release notes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;'p4 sync' now sports a '-p' option.  This allows the user to
sync files without the server keeping track of it.  This
option is very useful when populating  build clients or when
publishing content when there is no requirement for saving
the client workspace state.&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using this option reduced the amount of meta data stored, but it indirectly also  reduces the amount of meta data that needs to be loaded when the server calculates which files need to be synced.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use a Perforce Proxy for builds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This leaves us with the second problem, the files pulled of the depots. We cannot change the fact that we need to load the files, but we can change the location these files come from. Enter the Perforce Proxy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most Perforce users and administrators are aware of the Perforce Proxy that improves the speed and responsiveness for users in remote offices, but (maybe surprisingly) there is also a case for a Perforce Proxy in the main office where your Perforce server resides. The archived files will then be pulled of the drives of the Proxy server and not the main server. This will not only reduce contention on the disks but also, in the case of large build farms, reduce network access to the Perforce server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Separate Perforce server for builds&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thinking these ideas to their logical conclusion, one could also surmise a separate Perforce server dedicated to builds. The server would be created and updated via replication from the main Perforce server. The replication process could even filter out non-essential tables for the build such as db.have. No officially supported replication engine with this capability exists (yet), but there are some scripts in the Perforce public depot which provide this functionality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Alternative: Trust Perforce&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One could argue that there is actually no need for any of the above techniques if one where to trust Perforce to do the right thing. The db.have table is there for a purpose: to remember which files been altered compared to the files already in the workspace.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the build scripts separate the build artefacts cleanly from the source, there is really no reason to clear out and repopulate a build workspace for every build. This will reduce the strain on the Perforce server for every build considerably. How many files actually change in 10 minutes between two continuous integration builds?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conclusion&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a large and justifiable demand to run many builds a day, often for many products. With a little bit of forward thinking and some of the ideas mentioned above implemented, the Perforce server can process these builds without sacrificing responsiveness to the users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why don’t you have a talk with your build masters? If you are unsure or uncertain about any of the strategies, you can always ask one of your favourite consultants to help you out – for a small fee &lt;img src="http://blog.perforce.com/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":-)"&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy hacking&lt;/p&gt;

The result? All his lighting is now low-energy - and he's managed to slash his electricity bills by 60%&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't always like this.  A few months ago, I barely gave lightbulbs a thought. I never worried about start-up times, lumens per watt and colour spectra, or questioned whether I could find a suitable bulb for my most awkward sockets at home. The most exciting bulb-related thing to have happened to me was a late introduction, in my mid-20s, to recessed halogen spotlights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, it's bordering on an obsession. Everywhere I go, every room I enter,  I find myself calculating the wattage of the lights. From my dentist's chair last week, I noticed at least a dozen 50-watt halogens embedded in the ceiling and a smattering of fluorescent striplights (in addition to that super-bright lamp trained on my face). From my desk at work, I can count 160 striplights and 50 individual lightbulbs – some energy-efficient, many not, all switched on while it's bright and sunny outside. In a tiny clothes shop in Bristol, I counted 50 boiling hot, 35-watt spotlights all pointed at walls or into clothes – and that was just in the first half of the shop. All that electricity being wasted as heat; all those extra carbon emissions . . . My mental maths makes me scowl a lot these days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I'm not the only one with a bee in their bonnet about bulbs, of course. This year, newspapers and comment blogs have overflowed with (mostly angry) pieces about our gradual switch to greener lighting and, in particular, the parallel demise of traditional incandescent bulbs – now gradually being banned across Europe, much to the irritation of Euro- and climate change-sceptics everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lamenting the death of the incandescent bulb is as daft as complaining about cars becoming more fuel-efficient, or deciding you want a course of leeches instead of paracetamol to deal with a headache. Even if you don't buy into the climate and energy-saving argument, it makes sense to ditch incandescent bulbs purely on the grounds of the money you'll save on electricity bills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;My own transformation began with an innocent question about my life, as I was finally getting round to auditing the carbon footprint of my home earlier this year. As part of a larger plan to green my house, I had asked Russell Smith of the sustainable building company Eco Parity to carry out an energy survey of my freezing, energy-hungry Victorian terrace. He identified lighting as a major issue – the cost of powering the copious lightbulbs hanging from my ceilings and screwed or bayoneted into table lamps was spiking up my energy use and, consequently, my carbon footprint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those incandescent bulbs were identical to the vast majority of lights in the vast majority of British homes. In fact, most of the world still gets its artificial lighting from these glowing filaments of tungsten housed in a glass-enclosed vacuum, a design that has been around, virtually unaltered, for more than a century. In our climate-aware times, they represent an indefensible energy burden: up to  95% of the electricity each bulb draws is wasted as heat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, lighting accounted for 28% of my home's energy use and more than half the electricity bill. I was producing around 1.5 tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; every year just with my lights. This had to change. I had always known that swapping incandescent bulbs for more energy-efficient compact fluorescent lights (CFLs) would be one of the easiest ways to cut my carbon footprint, but I'd never actually quantified what this meant for me. CFLs, a miniature and more sophisticated version of fluorescent striplights, last around 10 times longer than incandescent bulbs and use up to 80% less energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the next few months, I spent (probably too many) evenings, weekends and lunchtimes hunting out and testing different energy-saving bulbs, each representative of even more cutting-edge lighting technology than the last. I got frighteningly familiar with terms such as GU10, R50, E14 and E27 (the technical labels for different shapes of bulb and socket – look, I did this so you don't have to). And I saw the future too, in super-bright light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Familiar in car dashboards and bicycle lights, they smash all records for energy efficiency. In a few years they will be all over your home too, and with none of the perceived stigma of CFLs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the time I emerged from this trek through the light side, my whopping 1.5-tonne CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; habit had dropped to less than 150kg per year. Think what would happen if everyone made such a cut. According to the Energy Saving Trust (EST), lights account for around 20% of the electricity bill in an average home. Britons spend around £2.3bn each year on electricity to run their home lights, and if everyone switched their old-style lights to energy-saving alternatives, the electricity saved in a single year would run the country's street lighting for four and a half years, or provide electricity for every house in London for nine months. If every UK householder replaced just one 100-watt incandescent bulb with an energy-saver, the carbon saved would be equal to taking 200,000 cars off the road for a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Negative myths about CFLs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments, too, have realised this is a quick win. At the beginning of this month, incandescent lightbulbs rated above 80 watts were banned across the 27 countries of the EU. Next year, bulbs over 65 watts will be banned, and so on in the following years until incandescents disappear entirely by the middle of the next decade. Bans have also been announced in countries around the world from the US and Australia to Brazil, Turkey and Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone is happy, though. According to their detractors, CFLs give out cold light, take ages to warm up, and might even make you ill. "Nearly all of our work seems to be trying to batter these myths down," says James Russill, a lighting expert at the EST. "There are a lot of wrong perceptions about energy-saving lightbulbs. In the early days, as the technology was developing, there were issues with warm-up times, general light output and their size. These are still at the forefront of a lot of people's minds – but the modern technology counters all of these problems."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's not as if the incandescent bulb hasn't had a good run. Invented in the late 19th century either by Joseph Swan or Thomas Edison (depending on which side of the Atlantic you live), the first designs generated light by passing electricity through a carbonised filament of bamboo; when this got hot, it would glow orange. The longer the filament, the more light came out, so to ensure bulbs remained a practical size, later versions used long strips of bamboo curled into tight coils.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By the start of the 20th century, tungsten had replaced bamboo because it was the material that survived longest at the hottest temperatures. The coiled filament was curled upon itself to create an even brighter filament – the so-called "coiled coil" – and placed in a vacuum or inert gas to give the filament longer life. And that, largely, is how incandescent lightbulbs have stayed for more than a century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorescent lights, meanwhile, first appeared more than 80 years ago. By passing electricity through mercury gas, they produce lots of ultraviolet light that is absorbed by a phosphor chemical lining the inside of the glass tube – the phosphor then re-emits the energy as visible white light. A fluorescent tube is more expensive to make than an incandescent lamp, but the process it uses to make light is at least five times more efficient. (The efficiency of a lamp is measured in the amount of light, measured in lumens, produced per watt of power it uses: an incandescent light produces around 10 lumens per watt, halogen spotlights push that to around 20, while modern fluorescents produce 50-60.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fluorescents swamped offices and factories in the 50s and 60s, yet inefficient incandescent lights remained popular in homes, largely thanks to their warm yellowish light. And things would have stayed that way if it wasn't for a development in the phosphor chemicals in fluorescent lights in the 70s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of producing one phosphor that produced white light, we took three – green, red and blue – and  mixed them to get white," explains Mike Simpson, technical and design director of Philips Lighting. "One of the spin-offs was that these were less sensitive to heat so you could run them hotter, but they also gave much better colour quality."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also meant manufacturers could modify the colour of the light coming out of fluorescent tubes, and make them thinner. By 1980, the first compact fluorescent lights were being made by bending thin tubes double and putting them into a glass container, much like a jam jar, attached to a bayonet socket base. "Back then, you'd take out a 100-watt incandescent and put in a 20-watt fluorescent," Simpson says. "Everything that has happened in the past 20 years has been to make it smaller and more efficient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At home, I had a mixture of incandescent bulbs rated from 20 to 100 watts. The kitchen alone had seven reflector bulbs at 50 watts each, the upstairs bathroom had another four at 40 watts – in total, I had at least 1,500 watts of lighting around the house.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Replacing the main light in each room was simple: these days, there's a whole range of cheap, reliable CFLs. The colour of the lights wasn't even an issue (if it matters, you can often choose how yellow you'd like the light to be) and the start-up time for my new lightbulbs was near-instantaneous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More problematic were the downlighters in my kitchen and bathroom. There seemed to be fewer low-energy options, and it took a lot of digging to find suitable spotlight-shaped bulbs. I eventually found some made by the low-energy lighting company Megaman on specialist lighting websites (although I have since seen the same bulbs at DIY stores, and they are becoming more available at mainstream stores and supermarkets).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The difference the new lights has made to my carbon footprint and my wallet is clear: from 1,500 watts of lights in the house, I now have around 150 watts doing the same job. By removing 90% of the lighting power, I have reduced my monthly electricity bills by around 60%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The future is LEDs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So is that the end of my lighting story? Not quite. Where CFL technology was 20 years ago, another lighting technology is ramping up to further reduce our energy bills. LEDs have been around since the 60s, producing light by passing electricity between thin layers of different semi-conductor materials. Until now, they have only been useful as indicator lights on telephones, car dashboards and dot-matrix displays. They are costly, used only to be available in certain colours (reds or oranges, typically), and weren't bright enough for lighting entire rooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-90s, however, Japanese scientists invented the first blue LEDs. By coating these with a phosphor, LEDs could finally produce white light, prompting the big electronics companies to accelerate their development of LED bulbs. Philips recently produced a 3-watt bulb that has the same light output as a 35-watt halogen incandescent bulb – it is expensive (£25), but Philips claims it will last for 15 years. Factor in the amount of electricity the bulb will save and, overall, it could turn out well for your pocket and the planet. If all of the UK's domestic lighting was switched to LEDs, the electricity burden for lighting could be 10% of what it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like all technology, LEDs will no doubt get better and cheaper. Is it too much to hope that, within a couple of decades, all the lighting in one house will use the equivalent energy of a single incandescent lamp today, bringing the carbon footprint of lighting our homes to virtually nothing? At least that would stop me scowling at shopkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Trip the light fantastic Alok Jha's recommended lightbulbs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LED spotlight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips Econic, 3W&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike CFLs, this switches to full brightness immediately and runs cooler. Identical size to halogen spotlights and very similar colour light, though less sparkly. Quite a tightly focused light, however, so you will need a few around your room. Also relatively expensive, but then it will last for 15 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CFL stick&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips Genie, 8W&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Has near-instantaneous start-up, getting up to full brightness with a warm, yellowy-white colour in less than 10 seconds. Good for general use in lounges, hallways and bedrooms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LED candle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Philips Novallure, 10W&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Same advantages as the Econic in terms of cool running and instant switch-on, but this is meant for chandeliers.

I’ve been beta-testing Birdfeed for a long time, and it is truly worth your attention. It looks good and feels smart, and it has some features which, once you get used to them, you can’t believe aren’t in every iPhone Twitter client. Among my favorites:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scroll to the bottom of a list of tweets and Birdfeed will start loading more, from further back chronologically, automatically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Update timestamps in tweet lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your last loaded tweets are stored locally in a database, so you can fire up Birdfeed on an airplane and read what was there when last you launched it with a network connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Comparing Birdfeed to other good — but very different — Twitter apps like Tweetie and Twitterrific is exactly what I had in mind when I wrote “&lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/2009/04/twitter_clients_playground"&gt;Twitter Clients Are a UI Design Playground&lt;/a&gt;”.&lt;/p&gt;
