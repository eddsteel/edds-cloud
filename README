Code for my site.

All information is gathered from other parts of the web, and stored in a
CouchDB database. At present information is gathered by RSS from google
reader, delicous and twitter, and loaded manually.

Future plans:

* Automatic updating
* Site support
** twitter API for richer metadata
** github commits
** flickr activity
